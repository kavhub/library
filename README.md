**How OSLO works**

OSLO uses the familiar [fork-and-pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) collaboration model. Any GitHub user wishing to contribute should fork the repository, make additions or other modifications, and then submit a pull request. GitHub pull requests should be accompanied by supporting comments and/or issues.
